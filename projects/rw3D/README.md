# Random Walk 3D

View it here: http://zb3.github.io/rw3D


This thing tries to visualize how a random walk would look in 3D, from the first person perspective. This is not a true random walk, because you only have 5 of 6 possible direction choices (you cannot go backwards). (Pull requests to change this welcome).

Also, you can choose directions, but remember that if you do this too late, the app won't respect your choice, as it needs to be made before the animation starts.

More details in the info message :)

**Note:** This has some minor precision problem, which can be observed as "camera shake" at the end of rotation sometimes. It's not a bug, there's just some precision loss somewhere. If you know how to fix it, please let me know :)
