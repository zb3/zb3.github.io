			This is my website although I do not have one :)<br><br>
			This page contains my legacy projects as well as the infamous "Tools" section which I am using almost everyday and which has inspired me to recreate this website as it's been completely erased by the web hosting provider (thanks btw).<br><br>
			So, feel free to explore this site but keep in mind that it contains code from 2010 which is ehh..... not very good...<br><br>
			For future projects, please watch me on GitHub here: <a href="http://github.com/zb3">http://github.com/zb3</a><br><br>
			Oh, and I almost forgot... you can send me an email:
			<a href="mailto:onlylogout@gmail.com">onlylogout@gmail.com</a>, reply within 100 years, I promise :)
